			<li>Starting the shell and outline of the website with a bunch of different stuff, looked at the different pages I wanted to have and set up the page documents as well as the different css files. Will look into the javaScript functions later to maybe add some flare. I've always had a hard time being creative, so there will probably be a bunch of stuff from different websites just to demonstrate skill. In addition to this page I also have a todo list of neat things that I want to look at and will hopefully will get to the majority of those before I feel like I'm finished.</li>
			<li>In order to have a div float within a div you have to set a specific height or the 2 will not go together. By setting the height of the container div I was able to float the child div and still be able to float right. That may become a problem if I put to much into the child div or during mobile reponsive stuff.</li>

			<li>Started working on the nav bar by adding some style including background color and hover functionality. </li>
			<li>Tried to add button movement to click when following links, this causes the buttson to move around when I click on one and really annoys me so I'll work on getting that corrected.</li>
			<li>Tried really hard to make the buttons largers and the entire button clickable, I used the a tag and removed margins and padding to cover the entire element so that you can click anywhere on the "button" to make it follow the link. Sadly this has left me with links that I cannot center the text vertically and I can't seem to figure out how to do that without losing the entire link as a button. May come back to this later.</li>
			<li>Beat myself up for about an hour trying to get the image of an emperor scorpion on the front page before realizing that I can set the size to 100% in the actual tag to make it fit the container. When I say realizing, I really mean my buddy pointed it out and then looked at me like I was an idiot. /facepalm.</li>
			<li>I also made an easter egg for the main page, the "challenge accepted" guy in plain text for anyone that looks at the actual source code. It doesn't look fantastic or anything but it makes me happy.</li>

			<li>Worked the sidetracks bar, had the hardest time trying to get the sublist items to appear on the right side and still line up with the container. Saw an example that just moved it with pixels /facepalm. I had been beating my head against the wall on that one for hours sadley. Made a jfiddle of what happened with notes and a link to it on the site so I can show off my fiddles somewhere and remember if I get stuck doing something like that again. I have been taking a lot of notes in the code itself, I may move most of that to jfiddle to keep the code clean and easier to read.</li>
